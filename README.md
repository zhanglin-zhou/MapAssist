## FAQ

**Will I get banned?**

We want to be optimistic, probably not, but I can't make any warranty or guarantee. Use at your own risk.

**What is this program?**

It's a very basic overlay at the moment and an external tool to generate the map.

**How do I ...?**

You can donate and then ask the project owner directly for assistance, you can find him on Discord.
